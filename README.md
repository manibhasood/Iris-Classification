# Iris Species Classification

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning techniques. Our model achieves an impressive 98% accuracy on the classic Iris dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic in the field of machine learning and contains the following:

- 3 different Iris species:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolour
  - Virginica
- 150 total samples (50 for each species)
- 4 features for each sample:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width

## Project Goals

1. Preprocess and explore the Iris dataset
2. Develop a machine learning model for species classification
3. Achieve high accuracy (currently at 98%)
4. Provide insights into feature importance

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Model Performance

Our current model achieves a 98% accuracy in classifying Iris species. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and the separability of the Iris species based on their measured features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies:
3. Run `iris_classification.ipynb` to train the model and see results

## Key Files

- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Main script for data processing, model training, and evaluation
- `data/iris.csv`: The Iris dataset (if not using scikit-learn's built-in dataset)

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms
- Implement cross-validation for more robust performance estimation
- Create a web interface for real-time Iris species prediction
